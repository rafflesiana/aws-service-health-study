This resulted in impaired EC2 instances and degraded EBS volume performance for resources in the affected area of the Availability Zone. The overheating was caused by a control system failure that caused multiple, redundant cooling systems to fail in parts of the affected Availability Zone. The chillers were restored at 11:21 PM PDT and temperatures in the affected areas began to return to normal. As temperatures returned to normal, power was restored to the affected instances. By 2:30 AM PDT, the vast majority of instances and volumes had recovered. We have been working to recover the remaining instances and volumes.

This issue affects EC2 instances and EBS volumes in a single Availability Zone in the AP-NORTHEAST-1 region.
Aug 23,  4:18 AM PDT -  日本時間 2019年8月23日 12:36 より、AP-NORTHEAST-1 の単一のアベイラビリティゾーンで、一定の割合の EC2 サーバのオーバーヒートが発生しました。この結果、当該アベイラビリティゾーンの EC2 インスタンス及び EBS ボリュームのパフォーマンスの劣化が発生しました。このオーバーヒートは、影響を受けたアベイラビリティゾーン中の一部の冗長化された空調設備の管理システム障害が原因です。日本時間 15:21 に冷却装置は復旧し、室温が通常状態に戻り始めました。温度が通常状態に戻ったことで、影響を受けたインスタンスの電源が回復しました。日本時間 18:30 より大部分の EC2 インスタンスと EBS ボリュームは回復しました。 我々は残りの EC2 インスタンスと EBS ボリュームの回復に取り組んでいます。少数の EC2 インスタンスと EBS ボリュームが電源が落ちたハードウェア ホスト上に残されています。我々は影響をうけた全ての EC2 インスタンスと EBS ボリュームの回復のための作業を継続しています。 早期回復の為、可能な場合残された影響を受けている EC2 インスタンスと EBS ボリュームのリプレースを推奨します。いくつかの影響をうけた EC2 インスタンスはお客様側での作業が必要になる可能性がある為、 後ほどお客様個別にお知らせすることを予定しています。詳細は こちら をご参照ください。追加のご質問がある場合は、AWS サポートまでご連絡ください。 | Beginning at 8:36 PM PDT a small percentage of EC2 servers in a single Availability Zone in the AP-NORTHEAST-1 Region shutdown due to overheating. This resulted in impaired EC2 instances and degraded EBS volume performance for resources in the affected area of the Availability Zone. The overheating was caused by a control system failure that caused multiple, redundant cooling systems to fail in parts of the affected Availability Zone. The chillers were restored at 11:21 PM PDT and temperatures in the affected areas began to return to normal. As temperatures returned to normal, power was restored to the affected instances. By 2:30 AM PDT, the vast majority of instances and volumes had recovered. We have been working to recover the remaining instances and volumes. A small number of remaining instances and volumes are hosted on hardware which was adversely affected by the loss of power. We continue to work to recover all affected instances and volumes. For immediate recovery, we recommend replacing any remaining affected instances or volumes if possible. Some of the affected instances may require action from customers and we will be reaching out to those customers with next steps.Additional details are available here.

This is causing DNS lookups through these resolvers for a small number of AWS names to fail. We are doing our best to identify and contact these operators, as quickly as possible, and working with them to enhance their mitigations so that they do not cause impact to valid requests. If you are experiencing issues, please contact us so we can work with your operator to help resolve."

A data store used by a subsystem responsible for the configuration of Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks is currently offline and the engineering team are working to restore it. While the investigation into the issue was started immediately, it took us longer to understand the full extent of the issue and determine a path to recovery. We determined that the data store needed to be restored to a point before the issue began. In order to do this restore, we needed to disable writes. Error rates and latencies for the networking-related APIs will continue until the restore has been completed and writes re-enabled. We are working through the recovery process now. With issues like this, it is always difficult to provide an accurate ETA, but we expect to complete the restore process within the next 2 hours and begin to allow API requests to proceed once again. We will continue to keep you updated if that ETA changes. Connectivity to existing instances is not impacted. Also, launch requests that refer to regional objects like subnets that already exist will succeed at this stage, as they do not depend on the affected subsystem. If you know the subnet ID, you can use that to launch instances within the region.

Starting at 4:07 PM PST, customers began to experience increased error rates and latencies for the network-related APIs in the AP-SOUTHEAST-2 Region. Launches of new EC2 instances also experienced increased failure rates as a result of this issue. Connectivity to existing instances was not affected by this event. We immediately began investigating the root cause and identified that the data store used by the subsystem responsible for the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) regional state was impaired. While the investigation into the issue was started immediately, it took us longer to understand the full extent of the issue and determine a path to recovery. We determined that the data store needed to be restored to a point before the issue began. We began the data store restoration process, which took a few hours and by 10:50 PM PST, we had fully restored the primary node in the affected data store. At this stage, we began to see recovery in instance launches within the AP-SOUTHEAST-2 Region, restoring many customer applications and services to a healthy state. We continued to bring the data store back to a fully operational state and by 11:20 PM PST, all API error rates and latencies had fully recovered. Other AWS services - including AppStream, Elastic Load Balancing, ElastiCache, Relational Database Service, Amazon WorkSpaces and Lambda – were also affected by this event.

The issue is affecting the subsystem responsible for updating VPC network configuration and mappings when new instances are launched or Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI) are attached to instances, within the affected Availability Zone. This subsystem makes use of a cell-based architecture, which subdivides the Availability Zone into smaller cells, with each cell being responsible for the VPC network configuration and mappings for a subset of instances within the Availability Zone.

These elevated failures cause network configuration and mappings to be delayed or to fail for new instance launches and attachments of ENIs within the affected cell. The issue can also cause connectivity issues between an affected instance in the affected Availability Zone and newly launched instances within other Availability Zones in the US-EAST-1 Region, since updated VPC network configuration and mappings are not able to be updated within the affected Availability Zone.

We have identified the root cause and have been working to resolve the issue and restore the updating of VPC network configuration and mappings within the affected cell.

The increase in temperature is caused by a loss of power to the cooling units within the affected section of the Availability Zone. We have now restored power to a number of the cooling units within this section of the Availability Zone and are starting to see temperatures decreasing. We will continue to work through the remaining cooling units that are still offline, which will return temperatures to normal levels. Once temperatures have recovered, we would expect to see affected EC2 instances and EBS volumes begin to recover. Other systems, including EC2 and EBS APIs, are operating normally within the affected Availability Zone. Customers with affected EC2 instances and EBS volumes can attempt to relaunch in the affected Availability Zone, or another Availability Zone within the AP-NORTHEAST-1 Region.
10:42 AM PST -  (3:42AM JST)AP-NORTHEAST-1 リージョンのうちの 1 つのアベイラビリティーゾーン (apne1-az1) のある一部の区画で影響を受けていた冷却ユニットの多くの電源が回復しました。室温は通常のレベルに近い状況まで戻り、ネットワーク、EC2 および EBS ボリュームの回復処理を開始しています。ネットワークはすでに回復し、EC2とEBSボリューム の回復処理に着手しております。回復処理が始まると再起動が発生するため、お客様にはお使いのインスタンスでアクションをとっていただく場合がございます。EBSボリュームに関しましては、ボリュームが回復するにつれ、degraded I/Oパフォーマンスが通常に戻ります。 ”stopping” もしくは ”shutting-down” のまま止まってしまっているインスタンスに関しましては、回復処理が進むにつれ、 ”stopped” もしくは “terminated” に戻ります。| We have now restored power to the majority of the cooling units within the affected section of the Availability Zone (apne1-az1) in the AP-NORTHEAST-1 Region. Temperatures are now close to normal levels and we have begun the process of restoring networking, EC2 instances and EBS volumes. The network has been restored within the affected section of the Availability Zone and we are now working on EC2 instances and EBS volumes. As they begin to recover, customers may need to take action on their instance as it will have experienced a reboot. For EBS volumes, degraded I/O performance will return to normal levels as volumes recover. For instances that are stuck “stopping” or “shutting-down”, these will return to the “stopped” or “terminated” state as recovery proceeds.
11:26 AM PST -  (4:26AM JST) AP-NORTHEAST-1 リージョンのうちの 1 つのアベイラビリティーゾーン (apne1-az1) で影響を受けていた冷却サブシステムの電源が回復しました。現在、室温は通常レベルで運用されています。大部分の ES2 インスタンスと EBS ボリュームが復旧しておりますが、残りのインスタンスとボリュームの復旧作業に引き続き取り組んでいます。| We have now restored power to the cooling subsystem within the affected section of the Availability Zone (apne1-az1) in the AP-NORTHEAST-1 Region. Temperatures are now operating at normal levels. We are also seeing recovery for the majority of EC2 instances and EBS volumes and continue to work on the remaining instance and volumes.
12:09 PM PST -  (5:09AM JST)アベイラビリティゾーン (apne1-az1) で影響を受けた一部の区画の室温は安定し、通常のレベルに戻りました。多くの EC2インスタンスは回復済みとなっております。多くの EBSボリュームも回復済みですが、残りの少数のボリュームの復旧作業に引き続き取り組んでおります。| Temperatures within the affected section of the Availability Zone (apne1-az1) remain stable and at normal levels. We have now recovered the vast majority of EC2 instances. The majority of EBS volumes have also recovered but there are a few that have required some engineering intervention that we are working on.
12:54 PM PST -  (5:54AM JST)日本時間 02/19 11:01 PM から、AP-NORTHEAST-1 リージョンのうちの１つのアベイラビリティーゾーンの一部の区画で室温の上昇を確認いたしました。日本時間 02/19 11:03 PM から、室温が上昇した結果として、一部の EC2インスタンスが影響を受け、一部のEBSボリュームではパフォーマンスが低下しました。根本的な原因は、影響を受けたアベイラビリティーゾーンのセクション内の冷却システムへの電力の喪失であり、すでに回復済みです。日本時間 02/20 03:30 AM までに、電力は冷却システム内のほとんどのユニットで復旧し、室温は通常のレベルに戻りました。日本時間 02/20 04:00 AM までに、EC2 インスタンスと EBS ボリュームの回復が始まり、日本時間 02/20 05:30 AM 時点で、影響を受けた EC2 インスタンスと EBS ボリュームの大部分は通常通り動作しております。一部のインスタンスとボリュームは、イベントによって影響を受けたハードウェア上でホストされていました。引き続き影響を受けたすべてのインスタンスとボリュームの復旧に取り組み、Personal Health Dashboard を通じて、現在も影響を受けているお客様に対し通知を行います。即時の復旧が必要な場合は、影響を受けているインスタンスまたはボリュームを置き換えていただくことをお勧めします。| Starting at 6:01 AM PST, we experienced an increase in ambient temperatures within a section of a single Availability Zone within the AP-NORTHEAST-1 Region. Starting at 6:03 AM PST, some EC2 instances were impaired and some EBS volumes experienced degraded performance as a result of the increase in temperature. The root cause was a loss of power to the cooling system within a section of the affected Availability Zone, which engineers worked to restore. By 10:30 AM PST, power had been restored to the majority of the units within the cooling system and temperatures were returning to normal levels. By 11:00 AM PST, EC2 instances and EBS volumes had begun to recover and by 12:30 PM PST, the vast majority of affected EC2 instances and EBS volumes were operating normally. A small number of remaining instances and volumes are hosted on hardware which was adversely affected by the event. We continue to work to recover all affected instances and volumes and have opened notifications for the remaining impacted customers via the Personal Health Dashboard. For immediate recovery, we recommend replacing any remaining affected instances or volumes, if possible."
